                        Our solution has several reports that can be generated, including a report on the work hours of each employee in each
                        project and work team. This report can be used to track employee productivity and to identify any areas where employees
                        may be slacking off.

                        Trackgenix has a time-tracking feature that allows employees to log their work hours for each project and work team.
                        This feature is useful for businesses to track the work hours of their employees and to ensure that they are being used
                        efficiently.

                        Our software has helped us to improve our resource management by allowing employees to log their work hours in a central
                        location. This has made it easier for managers to track employee productivity and identify areas where improvements can
                        be made.

                        The app will allow each employee to log in and select the project they are working on and the work team they are part of.
                        They will then be able to select the hours they worked and submit them. The app will then calculate the total hours
                        worked for each employee and project.
